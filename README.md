# BirthdayBookProject
A simple python program I made for a student I was tutoring to showcase and explain some basic features of python and object oriented programming. It stores people's names and their birthdays. 
This code includes examples that helped the student learn exception handling, format specifiers, lists, for/while loops, if statements, objects, classes, encapsulation, casting and user input.
For most of the program, user input is assumed to have no errors.
